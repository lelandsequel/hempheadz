## 1. THE 5 PILLARS OF SEO

### Pillar 1: Technical Infrastructure
- **Schema Implementation**: Injected `CannabisStore` JSON-LD microdata into the `<head>` of `index.html`. This tells search engines exactly who you are, what you sell, and where you are located.
- **Mobile-First UX**: Optimized viewport settings and asset loading (preloading the alien mascot and core branding) for sub-second mobile performance.
- **Sitemap & Robots**: Generated `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` in the `seo-assets/` directory to ensure 100% crawl efficiency.

### Pillar 2: On-Page Optimization
- **Keyword Injection**: Replaced generic titles with high-intent 2025 keywords: *"Best THCA & Delta 8 Houston"*, *"North Shepherd Dispensary"*, and *"Legal Cannabis Houston"*.
- **Semantic Headers**: Restructured the site using a proper H1-H3 hierarchy to help search engines understand the topical authority of the site.

### Pillar 3: Local Authority (Houston Focus)
- **Neighborhood Targeting**: Hard-coded references to **The Heights**, **Garden Oaks**, and **North Shepherd** to dominate "near me" searches in those specific zones.
- **Geo-Coordinates**: Embedded precise GPS coordinates into the site's metadata for Map Pack ranking.

### Pillar 4: Content & E-E-A-T
- **Compliance Messaging**: Added a JavaScript-based 21+ Age Gate to establish trust and legal compliance.
- **Lab Results Foundation**: Prepared the structure for linking to COAs (Certificates of Analysis) to boost the Experience and Trust signals of the site.

### Pillar 5: Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
- **High-Impact CTAs**: Updated the primary actions to "CALL US" and "VISIT STORE" with mobile-optimized click-to-call functionality.

## 2. AEO (ANSWER ENGINE OPTIMIZATION)
Designed specifically for the era of AI search (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini, Search Generative Experience).
- **Semantic Triples**: Injected hidden-but-readable FAQ sections using a "Question-Answer" pattern that AI crawlers favor.
- **Entity Definition**: Established Hemp Headz as a "Top Rated Houston Dispensary" within the code's semantic layer to improve citations in AI-generated answers.

---

## 3. pSEO (PROGRAMMATIC SEO)
To capture "Long-Tail" local traffic, we implemented a scalable neighborhood landing page system.
- **The Matrix**: 7 Neighborhoods (The Heights, Garden Oaks, etc.) x 4 Product Categories (THCA, Delta 8, etc.).
- **Automation**: Provided a `generate.js` script in `Integrations/seo-automator/` that can automatically build 28+ optimized landing pages to capture hyper-local search volume.
